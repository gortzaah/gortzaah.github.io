⭐ I’m a Ph.D. candidate working with [Dr. David Basanta](https://www.moffitt.org/research-science/researchers/david-basanta-gutierrez/) and [Dr. Andriy Marusyk](https://www.moffitt.org/research-science/researchers/andriy-marusyk/) at the [Department of Integrated Mathematical Oncology](https://www.moffitt.org/research-science/divisions-and-departments/quantitative-science/integrated-mathematical-oncology/) at H. Lee Moffitt Cancer Center and Research Institute & University of South Florida. See the **Bio** for a detailed introduction.


🧬 I research the evolvability of cancer cells – how the diversification and selection shape the evolution of specific cancer phenotypes. Specifically, I am interested in:
* understanding how evolvability shapes the evolution of cancer treatment resistance,
* learning how to harness evolvability to prevent further disease development,
* translating the outcomes of the cancer evolution research to clinical practice.
I primarily use mathematical modeling for my research. Because of the interdisciplinary nature of my research, I am actively collaborating with experimental biologists. See the **Research** for an in-depth description of my scientific interests (link to be inserted).

🎓 I completed M.Sc. in Mathematical Sciences from KAIST 🇰🇷, M.Sc.Eng. in Mathematical Modeling and Computation from DTU 🇩🇰, and I worked as a research assistant at the Department of Molecular and Integrative Physiology at the University of Michigan Medical School ❄️. See the **CV** for the complete list of professional activities.

🐾 Outside work, you will find me running, traveling, sampling beer from local breweries, enjoying live music, and annoying my cat Wódeczkat.

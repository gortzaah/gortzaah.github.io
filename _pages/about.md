I hold a Ph.D. in Integrated Mathematical Oncology. I develop realistic mathematical models to understand the evolution of cancer and other complex biological processes. The essential part of my work involves integrating quantitative predictions with real-world experimental or clinical data obtained through close collaborations with clinicians and experimental biologists, allowing my model to have interdisciplinary and translational impact. 


## üß¨ Past research focus 
I primarily use mathematical modeling and data analysis for my research. Some of my previous research focused on the following problems: 
* PhD: To understand when, why, and how specific mutation rates benefit cancers adapting to treatment. I also investigated the role of metabolic conversion in the emergence of treatment resistance, using pharmacokinetic (PK) modeling, and the limits of extrachromosomal DNA (ecDNA) during cancer evolution. 
* Research Assistant: Modeling autocatalytic enzyme kinetics and analyzing reaction kinetics databases
* M.Sc.: Detecting causality in circadian rhythms models and data
  

## üéì Education & Experience  
I completed a Ph.D. at the Department of [Integrated Mathematical Oncology](https://www.moffitt.org/research-science/divisions-and-departments/quantitative-science/integrated-mathematical-oncology/) at Moffitt Cancer Center & the University of South Florida (FL, USA). I also completed M.Sc. in Mathematical Sciences from Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST, South Korea), M.Sc.Eng. in Mathematical Modeling and Computation from the Technical University of Denmark (DTU, Denmark), and I worked as a research assistant at the Department of Molecular and Integrative Physiology at the University of Michigan Medical School (MI, USA).

## üë©‚Äçüéì Name & Pronouns 
My full name is Malgorzata Tyczynska Weh. My pronouns are _she/her_ or _Dr_.

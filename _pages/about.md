I’m a Ph.D. Candidate at the Department of [Integrated Mathematical Oncology](https://www.moffitt.org/research-science/divisions-and-departments/quantitative-science/integrated-mathematical-oncology/) at H. Lee Moffitt Cancer Center and Research Institute & University of South Florida. I aim to understand the impact of evolvability on cancer progression under the supervision of Dr. [David Basanta](https://www.moffitt.org/research-science/researchers/david-basanta-gutierrez/) and Dr. [Andriy Marusyk](https://www.moffitt.org/research-science/researchers/andriy-marusyk/). 

Long story short, I ❤️ [MathOnco](https://mathematical-oncology.org/). 


## Research focus 🧬 

I research the evolvability of cancer cells – how the diversification and selection shape the evolution of specific cancer phenotypes. Specifically, I am interested in:
* Understanding how evolvability shapes the evolution of cancer treatment resistance,
* Learning how to harness evolvability to prevent further disease development,
* Translating the outcomes of the cancer evolution research to clinical practice.
I primarily use mathematical modeling for my research. Because of the interdisciplinary nature of my research, I am actively collaborating with experimental biologists (and hopefully clinicians in the future).

See the **Research** for an in-depth description of my scientific interests and **Publications** for the work I completed. 

## Education 🎓 
I completed M.Sc. in Mathematical Sciences from KAIST 🇰🇷, M.Sc.Eng. in Mathematical Modeling and Computation from DTU 🇩🇰, and I worked as a research assistant at the Department of Molecular and Integrative Physiology at the University of Michigan Medical School ❄️. 

See the **CV** for the complete list of professional activities. 


## Name & Pronouns 👩‍🎓
My pronouns are _she/her_. I'm publishing under the name _Malgorzata Tyczynska **Weh**_.

Hi! I'm Gosia and this is my academic page under construction. Stay tuned! 😸
==


⭐ I’m a Ph.D. candidate working with [Dr. David Basanta](https://www.moffitt.org/research-science/researchers/david-basanta-gutierrez/"David") and Dr. Andriy Marusyk (link) at the Department of Integrated Mathematical Oncology at H. Lee Moffitt Cancer Center and Research Institute (insert link) & University of South Florida (insert link). See the Bio for a detailed introduction (link).


🧬 I research the evolvability of cancer cells – how the diversification and selection shape the evolution of specific cancer phenotypes. Specifically, I am interested in:
understanding how evolvability shapes the evolution of cancer treatment resistance,
learning how to harness evolvability to prevent further disease development,
translating the outcomes of the cancer evolution research to clinical practice.
I primarily use mathematical modeling for my research. Because of the interdisciplinary nature of my research, I am actively collaborating with experimental biologists. See the Research for an in-depth description of my scientific interests (link).

🎓 I completed M.Sc. in Mathematical Sciences from KAIST ( 🇰🇷), M.Sc.Eng. in Mathematical Modeling and Computation from DTU ( 🇩🇰), and I worked as a research assistant at the Department of Molecular and Integrative Physiology at the University of Michigan Medical School ( ❄️). See the CV for the complete list of professional activities (link).

🐾 Outside work, you will find me running, traveling, sampling beer from local breweries, enjoying live music, and annoying my cat Wódeczkat.

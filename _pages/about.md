I focus on developing implementable, mathematically driven strategies to improve cancer treatment. The essential aspect of my work involves integrating quantitative predictions with real-world experimental or clinical data obtained through close collaborations with clinicians and experimental biologists. This allows my work to have a much-needed interdisciplinary and translational impact. 

## 👩‍🎓 Name & Pronouns 
I go by Gosia. My full name is Malgorzata Tyczynska Weh; Weh is my last name. My pronouns are _she/her_, and you can also call me _Dr_. 

## 🧬 Past research focus 
I primarily use mathematical modeling and data analysis for my research. Some of my previous research focused on the following problems: 
* PhD: To understand when, why, and how specific mutation rates benefit cancers adapting to treatment. I also investigated the role of metabolic conversion in the emergence of treatment resistance, using pharmacokinetic (PK) modeling, and the limits of extrachromosomal DNA (ecDNA) during cancer evolution. 
* Research Assistant: Modeling autocatalytic enzyme kinetics reactions. I also analyzed reaction kinetics databases for the reproducibility of reported biological constants and worked on inferring patterns of cyst formation in oocyte development (early embryogenesis).  
* M.Sc.: Developed and evaluated methods for detecting causality in circadian rhythms models and synthetically-generated data of oscillatory gene expression patterns.

## 🎓 Education & Experience  
I hold a Ph.D. in Integrated Mathematical Oncology, two M.Sc.-level degrees in applied mathematics and mathematical modeling, and over 10 years of research experience from academic centers worldwide. 

I completed a Ph.D. at the Department of Integrated Mathematical Oncology at Moffitt Cancer Center & the University of South Florida (FL, USA). I also completed M.Sc. in Mathematical Sciences from Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST, South Korea), M.Sc.Eng. in Mathematical Modeling and Computation from the Technical University of Denmark (DTU, Denmark), and I worked as a research assistant at the Department of Molecular and Integrative Physiology at the University of Michigan Medical School (MI, USA).

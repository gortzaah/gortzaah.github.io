**Recent focus**
Summertime project! I am currently exploring the potential of superivised AI models to recognize changes in the TME permitting selection for resistant cancer clones. 


**Previous research**
My previous research spanned across many areas of mathematical and computational biology, from stochastic modeling of circadian networks to cancer evolution. See pulications for the reference

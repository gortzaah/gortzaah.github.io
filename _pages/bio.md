# I'm the problem - it's me! 

I'm originally from Wroclaw, Poland. I moved to Denmark at the age of 13 and stayed there for the next decade (ish). I completed my Bachelor of Science in Engineering at the Technical University of Denmark (DTU) between Aug 2012 - Jan 2016. I did a semester abroad at the Oregon State University in Oregon during this time (Jan 2015 - Jul 2015). Inspired by this travel, I decided to pursue a dual Master's degree -- to earn M.Sc.Eng.  in Mathematical Modeling and Computation from DTU, while simultaneously completing M.Sc. in Mathematical Sciences at KAIST, Republic of Korea. I completed both degrees between Feb 2016 - Jan 2018. 

These broad educational experiences taught me a lot about how our world works, how diverse it is, and how much I love research. 

In Aug 2018 I moved to Ann Arbor, Michigan, to do mathematical biology research and to figure out "what's next". The "next part" turned out to be the Ph.D. at Moffitt, moving to Tampa during Covid and become a cat mom! 

If you're lost, here's a sketch of my travels and degrees:

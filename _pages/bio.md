# I'm the problem - it's me! 

I'm originally from Wroclaw, Poland. I moved to Denmark at the age of 13 and stayed there for the next decade (ish). I completed my Bachelor of Science in Engineering at the Technical University 


Speak to me in three languages - English, Polish and Danish. If you want to get a good laugh, talk with me in German.

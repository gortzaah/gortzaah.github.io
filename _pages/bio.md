Originally from Poland, I moved to Denmark at the age of 13 and lived there for the next decade (ish). I completed my Bachelor of Science in Engineering at the Technical University of Denmark (DTU) between Aug 2012 - Jan 2016. I did a semester abroad at Oregon State University in Oregon during this time (Jan 2015 - Jul 2015). Inspired by this travel, I decided to pursue a dual Master's degree -- to earn M.Sc.Eng.  in Mathematical Modeling and Computation from DTU, while simultaneously completing M.Sc. in Mathematical Sciences at KAIST, Republic of Korea. I completed both degrees between Feb 2016 - Jan 2018. 

These experiences taught me a lot about how our world works, how beautifully diverse it is, and how much I love research. 

In Aug 2018 I moved to Ann Arbor, Michigan, to do mathematical biology research and to figure out what's next. The "next" turned out to be the Ph.D. at Moffitt, where I moved to Tampa during COVID-19 (August 2020) and became a cat mom! I completed my Ph.D. in May 2025, and I am currently preparing for a trip in a camper van to Alaska - taking a short break from research before committing to postdoctoral training and applying mathematical modeling for clinical purposes.
